# CartoTaco Improvement Roadmap

This document outlines potential improvements to enhance CartoTaco's functionality, performance, and user experience.

## ✅ Completed Improvements

1. **Query Optimization** - Reduced initial data fetch from 6 queries to 1 via database view (~60-70% faster load time)
2. **Search & Filter Bar** - Added comprehensive filtering by name, proteins, type, spice level, and open hours
3. **Marker Clustering** - Efficient clustering of map markers for scalability and clean visualization
4. **Mobile Responsive Design** - Comprehensive mobile-first responsive overhaul with optimized layouts for all screen sizes
5. **User Authentication System** - Complete auth flow with transparent login/signup UI and protected routes
6. **User Location Submissions** - Community-driven submission system with geocoding, interactive map picker, and admin review workflow
7. **Dark Mode** - Theme toggle with light/dark/auto modes and time-based automatic switching (6am-8pm light, else dark)
8. **User Favorites System** - Heart icon favorites with filtering, dedicated favorites page, and map integration
9. **Vercel Deployment** - Configured adapter-vercel with Node 20, SSR guards in stores
10. **Directions Deep-Link** - `DirectionsButton.svelte` detects iOS/Android/desktop and deep-links to Apple Maps, Google Maps intent, or Google Maps web respectively

See [QUERY_OPTIMIZATION.md](./QUERY_OPTIMIZATION.md), [SEARCH_FILTER.md](./SEARCH_FILTER.md), and [MARKER_CLUSTERING.md](./MARKER_CLUSTERING.md) for details.

## 🧹 Housekeeping & Maintenance

### ✅ Update README Documentation
**Status**: Completed (2026-02-11, commit 7a3824c)

### ✅ Fix Svelte Type Checking Warnings
**Status**: Completed (2026-02-11, commit 7a3824c)

### H1. Fix Inaccurate Dead-Code Comment in stores.js
**Status**: ✅ Completed — `combineArraysByEstId()` was removed entirely in the specialty data refactor

---

### H2. Remove Hardcoded Sample Specialty Data from stores.js
**Status**: ✅ Completed — `specialtiesBySite` removed; specialty data now embedded in `processedTacoData` via `sites_complete` view (`specialty_items`, `specialty_proteins`, `specialty_salsas` arrays)

---

### H3. Update CLAUDE.md Documentation
**Status**: ✅ Completed — Migration docs updated through 006; stale `specStore` and `specialtiesBySite` store references removed; `recentlyAddedSites` documented

---

### H4. Vercel Adapter Runtime Deprecation
**Status**: Noted

**Details**:
- `svelte.config.js` uses `runtime: 'nodejs20.x'` which is valid but deprecated
- In a future adapter-vercel release, this option will be removed in favor of Vercel project-level Node version config
- No immediate action needed, but should be tracked for when the adapter is updated

**Impact**: Future compatibility

**Effort**: Minimal (when needed)

---

## 🎯 Quick Wins (High Impact, Low Effort)

### 1. Database Query Optimization
**Current Issue**: 9 sequential Supabase queries on every page load

**Improvement**: Create a database view or stored procedure that joins all related tables (sites, descriptions, menu, hours, salsa, protein) into a single query

**Impact**: Reduce initial load time by ~60-70%

**Effort**: Moderate (1-2 days)

**Technical Details**:
- Create a PostgreSQL view or function in Supabase
- Combine sites, descriptions, menu, hours, salsa, and protein tables
- Single client query instead of 6+ separate calls
- Reduce network overhead and improve data consistency

---

### 2. Add Search & Filter Bar
**Feature**: Floating search bar on the map to filter by:
- Name
- Open now / Open at specific time
- Specific proteins (e.g., "show me fish tacos")
- Spice level range
- Has specialty items

**Impact**: Dramatically improves usability as you add more locations

**Effort**: Moderate (2-3 days)

**Technical Details**:
- Floating UI component over map (top center or top right)
- Filter derived store data before passing to map
- Update markers dynamically based on filters
- Add URL query params for shareable filtered views

---

## 🚀 User Engagement Features
